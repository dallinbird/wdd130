        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p class="WebSiteInfo">
        "WebSiteInfo" People that are in the market for a used car and want a quick resource for tools and adivce on what to look out for. From quick loan calculators to a rundown checklist of things to lookout for when getting behind the wheel of a potential candidate of a car. I am unaware of any other site that does what I am trying to do that is free so in that regard there are not many alternatives if any for the content of this site.
      </p >
      <p class ="MissionStatement">
        "MissionStatement" In December of 2022 I found myself in need of a new car. While shopping around I found myself wishing that I had some tools that I could use on the go so that I could substantiate some of the claims being made by used car salesmen. I also learned about things to look out for in used cars such as accident history and how that can affect future car problems depending on the issue. This website and its resources are inspired by what I went through in navigating the used car sales world and what I wished I had known or had available at the time. The idea for this website came about because I had bought a new used car and was talking about it to several people at work and I found that many of them were just asking me for tips and advice. I am not a mechanic or a car loving person, but I found that people cared to hear from the experience of someone like them that knew very little about buying new used cars and what I wished I had known. This site is for those people that know little about buying used cars for whatever reason to help them not get taken advantage of and mitigate regrets.
        (This will be on the home page more or less as is. I want something like this to be the first thing that a new user will see when entering the site. Editing and refining will also happen).
      </p>
      <p class = “DiscriptionOfSitePage1”>
        “DiscriptionOfSitePage1” This page will just host the mission statement of the website, some example circumstances where the tools would be beneficial. as well as some testimonials of people that have used the website. The testimonials are meant to be comedic in nature mixed in with some actual reviews.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2] Loan Calcluator</h3>
      <p class="loanCalculator">
        “loanCalculator” This page will be dedicated to the loan tools that I will want to implement into the website. The main calculator will be one where the user knows their interest rate, cost of the car, and about how long they will have to pay off the car. These numbers will be required but the idea is that the user may only have an idea of what kind of interest rate that they are going to be get so they can use the loan calculators to experiment with and see different outcomes. This may just end up being a page the describes how to build a loan calculator in excel or google sheets depending on the difficulty of displaying the outputs.

      <h3>[Page 3] advice</h3>
      <p class="TipsPage">
        “TipsPage” The Final Page will be for a variety of tips and advice that I wished I had known when I was buying a new used car. The most Prominent thing that I want to put here is a checklist to run through when seeing the car for the first time, questions to ask the owner/dealer, and what to lookout for and listen for when getting behind the steering wheel for a test drive if the user gets that far. Far too often I found myself forgetting things that I wanted to be mindful of when I got to the car because I had not written them down.
